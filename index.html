				<div class="text">
                                       The ability to understand the emotions lying behind a speech is what seperates a human from a machine.
				       Emotion is one of the biggest part of a speech which truly confers the meaning of speech. Thus, With
				       the increasing machinisation of the modern world, The human-machine interaction is one of the most looke
				       after research in today's scientific community. Our projects aim at classifying a speech into based on the
				       their emotions by extracting different features.

					<!-- Start edit here  -->
					The Growing use of Machines and the necessity for a Man-Machine interaction like human
					interaction is what that have motivated the researchers to work on this project. The
					Whole idea behind the project is to develop a system through which a machine can understand 
					the emotion of a human's speech. 
					
					Emotion detection is a tool which will define the course of a new age of interdependence of 
					human and machine.
					So,

					<div class="text">

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						The project aims at classification of basic human emotions like sad, happy, neutral 
						and angry in a speech. The essence of project rely upon the selection of features of
						speech that was responsible for various human emotions.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						We hace taken help of various research papers for the selection of features and further proceedings.
						One of them is the "CS239 stanford emotion detection from speech" and other one is "Survey on speech emotion 
						recognition: Features, classification schemes and databases by university of cairo"
						
						As gathered from reading various papers written on this topic, There are many features specifically
						needed for this project like LFPC, LPCC along with the common features like MFCC. There has been a lot
						of success in many areas of having a machine with emotion detection feature but there are still reasearch
						going on and researchers are bidding on achieving the man-machine interaction via speech very soon.

						<!-- Start edit here  -->
						We started with collecting the sample data from various sources. Then, we went on finding the particular
						features that were important and necessary for emotion detection (found after reading various research papers). We are now 
						in phase of extracting features from scratch. We have extracted some short-term features like MFCC, ZCR and others. We are 
						now on extracting LFPC, LPCC, LPC and others.

					The Approach is majorly divided into three steps :
					<ol>
					            <li> Data Collection
					            <li> Preprocessing and Feature selection
					            <li>Classification

						<div class="text">
						    We have collected data from various online sources which was recorded by 
						    semi-professional actors and we have also made some data ourselves too but
						    major training data is the online one.
